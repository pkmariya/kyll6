			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				Hi, this is Mariya hail from the popular knit town Tiruppur in Coimbatore district. I was blessed to explore & experience varied environments, different people and atmosphere at the very early age by studying in multiple schools at various small towns. This was due to frequent transfer of my father at his job. </p>

			<p>
				I'm the last of 3 children to my parents. My father worked in Tamilnadu State Government in various positions, finally as Deputy Divisional Development Officer while retiring from his services. My mother is a home maker. I have two siblings both of them elder and settled with their own business at my native town. Though I'm the last son to my parents I'm the first graduate in my family!</p>

				<h3>My Education</h3>
				<p>I have done my graduation in Maths & Chemistry and post graduation in Masters in Computer Applications. Then I enhanced myself by doing M.Tech in Information Technology which helped me in enriching my learnings and boosting my confidence further! </p>

			<h3>My Career</h3>
			<p> Rightafter my post graduation in Computer Applications, I joined, <blockquote id="bq1">National Aerospace Laboratories <b>(NAL)</b></blockquote> as Graduate Engineer Trainee working with great scientists in the research field of Aircraft Rudder Vibration Control Systems using C, Matlab programming and Digital Signal Processing. </p>
			<p> <b>NAL</b> gave me the platform to apply the theoritcal knowledge that I had gained in my graduation and helped me in application of it. This practical experience has brought me an interview opportunity with <b>HMA</b> kick-starting my journey in to software industry. <blockquote id="bq2">HMA Data Systems <b>(HMA)</b> </blockquote> </p>
			<p> Though my instinct told me that this is going to be a good beginning, I didn't realize that time how great it is going to be! My journey from Banaglore to Chennai to attend the interview was tougher than the interview itself. Due to festive season, and long holidays I couldn't get to board in any wheels that normally carry the human passengers but ended up loading on to one that carries Cattles! and thus my expedition into full-fledged software industry began in 2000. </p>
			<p> I always believe in the philosophy "It's not about opportunities it's about our readiness to grab then opportunity when it comes!" and thus the opportunity to work in one of the major IT giant in India - HCL came in and I had grabbed it with my two hands. <blockquote id="bq3"> HCL Technologies Ltd <b>(HCL)</b></blockquote>My initial goal was to survive atleast two years so that I can use the experience in HCL as my visiting card to get into future opportunities. But fortunately, I was blessed with able mentors and I could utilize it fully to equip myself and in turn deliver some good results expected off of my Role. Thus a glorious career with HCL was blossoming every year with new challenges and opportunities shaping me up personally and professionally well! </p>
